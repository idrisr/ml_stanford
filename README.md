============================================

Notes, source files, etc from Andrew Ng's online machine learning class
available [here](http://www.ml-class.org)

Misc:
------
All algorithms implemented using gnu-octave. 

For linear regression, I ported a solution to R and Python separately.

For logistic regression I implemented a solution using R.
