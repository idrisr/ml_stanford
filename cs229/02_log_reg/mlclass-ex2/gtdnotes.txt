If you don't trust a system it pops into your head

Your mind is limited in its ability to manage commits, because its handicapped
by having to do straight line processing.

Our brain does not have a brain.

If it had some brains, it would remind us when we could buy batteries, not when
we go pass the aisle.

Our mind does a crappy job, but it won't let up until it trusts there's a better
system that can handle it better. So our mind holds on to this - psyhcic RAM.

Our mind has no sense of past or future, so as soon as we get two things to do
we get stress cause our brain wants to do those two things at once.

There is usually an inverse proportion between the amount something is on your
mind and the amount it is getting done.

You don't have to like what you have to do just to get it off your system.
