David Allen: Getting Things Done 

If you don't trust a system it pops into your head

Your mind is limited in its ability to manage commits, because its handicapped
by having to do straight line processing.

Our brain does not have a brain.

If it had some brains, it would remind us when we could buy batteries, not when
we go pass the aisle.

Our mind does a crappy job, but it won't let up until it trusts there's a better
system that can handle it better. So our mind holds on to this - psyhcic RAM.

Our mind has no sense of past or future, so as soon as we get two things to do
we get stress cause our brain wants to do those two things at once.

There is usually an inverse proportion between the amount something is on your
mind and the amount it is getting done.

You don't have to like what you have to do just to get it off your system.

**In order to get things off your mind, you must**
Not by meditating or drinking - those have different purposes

You must capture, clarify, and organize your commitments AND

you will engage conciously with those commitments at the appropriate time

Your ability to refocus, rapidly, on the right things at the right horizon at
the right time is the super power of knowledge work

Perspective is your slipperiest and most valuable commodity. Therefore methods
for maintaing perspective are your most important tools.

**The two aspects of self-management**
Control - concious focused engagement, aware of all options at any time

Perspective - aligned and clear about decisions, directions, and priorities

       The matrix of self-management
----------------------------------------------
No Control, No Perspective - Reactor
Control,    No Perspective - Micro Manager
No Control,    Perspective - Crazy Maker
   Control,    Perspective - Master & Commander

***The GTD models***
Mastering Workflow: The five keys to gaining control
Horizon of focus: The six levels of work

***Mastring Workfolow***
1. Collect everything that has potential meeting -- this can take a while to do the
full dump

Anything that isn't supplies, decoration, equipment, reference material 
shouldnt be there 

Most people have no ideas how many committments they've made

2. Process - process that list about what you need to do with that list
most people's response for tools is fatigue. Make it clear.
Everything in my email is either attracting me or repulsing me.

3. Organize - organize it in such a way that you'll be reminded at the
appropriate correct time

4. Review - constantly be checking in that you have everything, otherwise your
mind will keep going back to it

5. Do

***Horizons of Focus***

50,000 ft - purpose, principles
40,000 ft - vision
30,000 ft - goals
20,000 ft - areas of focus / responsibility - this is where maintenance is
10,000 ft - the above will generage projects, things that require more than one
step
Runway - next actions - all this boils down to like 150 or so next actions

Go from bottom up, cause that's where our minds are right now!
