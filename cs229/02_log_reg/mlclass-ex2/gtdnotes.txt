David Allen: Getting Things Done 

If you don't trust a system it pops into your head

Your mind is limited in its ability to manage commits, because its handicapped
by having to do straight line processing.

Our brain does not have a brain.

If it had some brains, it would remind us when we could buy batteries, not when
we go pass the aisle.

Our mind does a crappy job, but it won't let up until it trusts there's a better
system that can handle it better. So our mind holds on to this - psyhcic RAM.

Our mind has no sense of past or future, so as soon as we get two things to do
we get stress cause our brain wants to do those two things at once.

There is usually an inverse proportion between the amount something is on your
mind and the amount it is getting done.

You don't have to like what you have to do just to get it off your system.

**In order to get things off your mind, you must**
Not by meditating or drinking - those have different purposes

You must capture, clarify, and organize your commitments AND

you will engage conciously with those commitments at the appropriate time

Your ability to refocus, rapidly, on the right things at the right horizon at
the right time is the super power of knowledge work

Perspective is your slipperiest and most valuable commodity. Therefore methods
for maintaing perspective are your most important tools.

**The two aspects of self-management**
Control - concious focused engagement, aware of all options at any time

Perspective - aligned and clear about decisions, directions, and priorities

       The matrix of self-management

No Control, No Perspective - Reactor
Control,    No Perspective - Micro Manager
No Control,    Perspective - Crazy Maker
   Control,    Perspective - Master & Commander
